  <p class="page-2">Lasagna originated in Italy, specifically from the region of Emilia-Romagna.
     It is a traditional Italian dish made by layering pasta sheets with meat sauce, cheese, and béchamel sauce, then baking until golden and bubbly.</p>
  <p class="page-2">This lasagna boasts a savory, rich flavor with a perfect balance of tangy tomato sauce, seasoned meat, creamy cheese, and tender pasta. Each bite offers a comforting blend of textures and a satisfying, hearty taste.</p>
  <h3 class="page-2 i">Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul class="page-2 i">
    <li>12 lasagna sheets</li>
    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
    <li>2 cups marinara sauce</li>
    <li>1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Fresh parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
  </ul>
    <h3 class="page-2">Steps</h3>
    <ol class="page-2">
      <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
      <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium heat until browned. Add the minced garlic, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper. Cook for another 2-3 minutes. Stir in the marinara sauce and let it simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>In a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, and half of the grated Parmesan cheese. Mix well.</li>
      <li>Cook the lasagna sheets according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
      <li>In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom. Place a layer of lasagna sheets over the sauce. Spread a layer of the ricotta mixture over the pasta, followed by a layer of meat sauce and a sprinkle of shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat these layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of meat sauce and mozzarella cheese on top. Sprinkle the remaining Parmesan cheese over the top.</li>
      <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
      <li>Let the lasagna cool for about 10 minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh parsley if desired. Enjoy!</li>
