  <h3 class="page-2 i">Ingredients:</h3>

  <ul id="cake" class="page-2 i">

    <li>1 (10-ounce) prepared angel food cake (store-bought or homemade from a mix, baked and cooled)</li>
    <li>1 (21-ounce) can cherry pie filling</li>
    <li>1 (3.4-ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix</li>
    <li>2 cups cold milk</li>
    <li>1 (8-ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed (or use fresh whipped cream)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup sliced almonds, toasted (optional)</li>

  <h3 class="page-2">Steps:</h3>
      
      <ol class="page-2">
      <li>Prepare the angel food cake according to the package instructions. Once baked, allow it to cool completely, then cut it into 1-inch cubes.</li>
      <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the instant vanilla pudding mix and cold milk until the mixture thickens, about 2 minutes. Let it sit for a few minutes to fully set.</li>
      <li>In a large trifle bowl or a deep glass dish, start layering the cake. Begin with a layer of angel food cake cubes at the bottom.</li>
      <li>Spread a layer of cherry pie filling over the cake cubes.</li>
      <li>Next, add a layer of the prepared vanilla pudding over the cherry pie filling.</li>
      <li>Spread a layer of whipped topping over the pudding layer.</li>
      <li>Repeat the layering process (cake, cherry pie filling, pudding, whipped topping) until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of whipped topping on top.</li>
      <li>Garnish the top of the cake with toasted sliced almonds for added texture and flavor, if desired.</li>
      <li>Cover the cake with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight, to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
      <li>Before serving, you can add extra cherry pie filling on top for garnish if desired. Serve chilled and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
